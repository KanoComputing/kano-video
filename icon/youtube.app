    "description": "YouTube is the world's biggest collection of movies and music, but in a web browser, it uses a piece of software called Flash â€“ this software is a bit old, a bit broken, and not open, so YouTube won't work in the browser of a Kano. Instead, this app gives you the control, to pull down videos directly from YouTube's API (Application Program Interface) and play them. Build a cool playlist for a party, or check out Kano's tutorial and project videos for more cool things to build with your computer.",
